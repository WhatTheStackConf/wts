### A by-developers, for-developers event in the heart of Skopje in September 19th, 2026

Most of us in this game tend to be on the wallflower side of the spectrum. Still, you can't deny the (very obvious) benefits of having a community to support and cheer for you.

WhatTheStack, for us, is the culmination of combined 20 years of community building efforts. We love going to conferences, meeting new people, learning new things...but sometimes, we get this feeling that these kinds of events are starting to get a bit too formal for our community culture. That's why we decided to make our own conference with blackjack and...Ha, got you. We decided to make a conference that won't be just ours. A conference that will be made by the passion of all the people who will attend WhatTheStack? So, hackers, developers, platform engineers, AI researchers, startup founders, and whatever title you choose (or may have been chosen for you)... welcome.

WhatTheStack is a conference. Surprising, we know. More importantly, it's a single-day, multi-track event that aims to celebrate technology, the web platform, AI, infrastructure and everything else that makes the modern stack what it is. It's never going to be the kind that expects a dress code of you. It's also __stacked__ with (pun very much intended) with authentic experiences, which may involve, but are not limited to:

- __Epic talks__ - And not just by the big names, but the folks who genuinely love the craft. Expect authentic, genuine insights on the entire spectrum from familiar faces you know from the internet and newcomers alike (which you'll probably know on the internet in a few years anyway).
- __Coffee__ - Yes, we have it. Yes, it's good.
- __Beers and Chill__ - Because let's face it, the best ideas sometimes come over a cold brew (and we mean beer this time). Or, y'know, just stick around for the chill part - soda's good too!
- __Gourmet Grub__ - C'mon, it's the Balkans. We know how to do food. Trust us, you'll try it and love it. You'll be back.
- __Community Vibes__ - This is where you'll find your tribe. Whether you're flying solo or rolling with your crew, you're among friends here. We're all about the vibes.


The ultimate goal for WhatTheStack is to become your yearly go-to conference. Since we're not we're not in the business of <code class="bg-base-100 px-2 py-0.5 rounded text-secondary-300 border border-secondary-500/30">Promise</code>s (pun also very much intended), here's what we'll deliver:

- The epic talks mentioned above
- Coffee, beer, amazing food
- Great community and even better vibes
